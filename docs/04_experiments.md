- Incomplete:
    - The payment feature is still under research due to the lack of resources for testing.
    - The search function is not yet optimal and is still under development, as it cannot perform comprehensive product searches.

    - Find methods to transfer data faster, especially image data.
    - Optimize the database.
    - Improve the product search functionality.
    - Add new features such as interactions between sellers and buyers, applying discount codes for products, etc.
